# Calculator - CalcSS3

This is a CSS3 remake of the well known iPhoneâ„¢ calculator. (No images needed, only CSS)<br>
This scientific calculator works just like most other calculators of its kind and probably<br>
doesn't need any further explanations ;o). 
Find some more info/help by clicking the '?' in the left top corner of the calculator's screen or see: [Using the Calculator](http://dematte.at/calculator#usage).

##Demo

CalcSS3 used to be an exercise to learn 'new' features from CSS3 in 2010, but I could not resist making it work... so I did. It is not a best practice example, it is a review from 2010, but it works quite good. Have fun!
